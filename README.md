# Real-Time Weather Data Hub

Building a weather data collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

## Overview

The Real-Time Weather Data Hub is a system designed to collect and manage weather data, leveraging cloud technologies and external APIs. It showcases core DevOps practices, including:

Integration with external APIs (OpenWeather API)
-Cloud-based storage solutions (AWS S3)
-Implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
-Effective version control using Git
-Python development methodologies
-Comprehensive error handling and debugging techniques

## Key Features

- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities using OpenWeather API
- Displays temperature (°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Securely saves weather data in AWS S3 using timestamps for unique identification and historical tracking
- Dyanamically supports multiple cities with tracking data

## Technical Architecture:

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (S3)
- **External API:** OpenWeather API
- **Dependencies:**
  - boto3 (AWS SDK)
  - python-dotenv
  - requests

## Setup Instructions

OpenWeather API Key: Create a free account at OpenWeather to get your API key.

Utilized VScode for efficiency

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Configure environment variables (.env):
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

3.Configure AWS credentials: ## Must have AWS Key and Secret Key
aws configure

5. Run the application:
   python3 src/weather_dashboard.py

What I Learned:

This project demonstrates how to integrate multiple technologies to create a robust and scalable Weather Data Collection System.
By leveraging APIs, cloud storage, and Python’s simplicity, you can efficiently collect and store data for further analysis or display.

Future Enhancements:
Alerts for extreme weather conditions
Implement data visualization
Create automated testing
Set up CI/CD pipeline
```
